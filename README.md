## What is a Bonus Code or Promo Code in Quotex?

A bonus code, also known as a promo code in Quotex is a special word,

FREE.

## How to use Quotex promo codes step-by-step

1.  ### Register to activate the promo code.

    One thing that you will notice if you try to use my promo code on
    your existing account is, it is not available.

    on this blog post to register.

## Other bonuses to take advantage of in Quotex

1.  ### Risk-free trades:

     this is a special kind of bonus offered to active traders to use in
    their daily trading. As the name suggests, Quotex risk-free trades
    are trades that remove all the risks from trading.

    For example, a trader who activates risk-free trades when trading
    gets back all his money equal to the risk-free trade amount when
    they lose a trade.

    Real-life scenario: if you have a risk-free bonus of, say, \$3 and
    you open a losing trade, Quotex will give you back all your money
    (\$3) from that trade.

2.  ### Cashback:

    This kind of bonus is more or less the same as the risk-free trades
    bonus but with a twist. Unlike risk-free trades that give you back
    all your lost money, cashback allows you to only receive a
    percentage of your trading volume back.

3.  ### Cancel X points:

     This is a tool used on Quotex to cancel a losing trade. If you use
    this tool you will salvage your money if your trade is losing.

4.  ### Percentage of turnover:

    This promo bonus allows you to get a percentage of your trading
    volume back when you trade.
